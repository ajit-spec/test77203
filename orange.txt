Oranges are citrus fruits known for their bright color and refreshing, sweet-tart flavor. Rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, they contribute to a healthy diet and are enjoyed worldwide fresh or as juice.
They originated in Southeast Asia and have been cultivated for thousands of years.
Oranges are cultivated in many regions with warm climates, including Brazil, the United States (especially Florida and California), Spain, and China. They grow on evergreen trees and can be categorized into different varieties such as navel, Valencia, and blood oranges.
Nutritionally, oranges are low in calories but high in nutrients. A single medium orange provides about 70 calories and contains fiber, potassium, and various essential vitamins. They are particularly beneficial for immune health, skin care, and can help improve heart health.
